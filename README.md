# Youtube-API-Fetcher

## Objective
* Make an API to fetch latest videos sorted in reverse chronological order of their publishing date-time from YouTube for a given tag/search query in a paginated response.
* Server should call the YouTube API continuously in background (async) with some interval (say 10 seconds) for fetching the latest videos for a predefined search query and should store the data of videos (specifically these fields - Video title, description, publishing datetime, thumbnails URLs and any other fields you require) in a database with proper indexes.
* A GET API which returns the stored video data in a paginated response sorted in descending order of published datetime.
* A basic search API to search the stored videos using their title and description.
* Add support for supplying multiple API keys so that if quota is exhausted on one, it automatically uses the next available key.
